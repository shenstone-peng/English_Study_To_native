Before we start our tour of club, I'll just run through the basic information about facilities we have here including recent improvements and explain the types of membership available
Our greatest asset is probably a swimming pool which at 25meters (isn't) Olympic size, but now we expanded it to 8 lanes. it's much wider
This means there rarely more than a couple of people at a time in each lane
Unfortunately, there isn't space for an outdoor pool here, but the glass roof on the swimming pool is partly retractable, which means you can enjoy something of open-air experience on warmer days
Our recently refurbished fitness suite has all the Wlatest exercise equipments including 10 new running machines and a wide range of weight-training machine
each member is given the full training in how to operate the equipment and there is always a trainer on duty to offer help and advice
